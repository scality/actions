# `@scality-actions/infra/pulumi/lib`

Library of reusable Pulumi component resources with multi-cloud support.

Components to build:

- [ ] generic parent to hold all other resources and store shared variables
- [ ] private network (with subnet(s), fixed IPs, security groups...)
- [ ] node (VM with ports and volume attachments)
- [ ] (_optional_) cluster (group of nodes with network(s), with shared identity)
